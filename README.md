# INF654-Assignment 4 - Prototype Web Application: Movie Log

This project is a follow-up to a previous prototype project where we'll be expanding it by integrating it with firebase. By integrating the firebase database we can store and handle data, we can also perform CRUD operations and user authentication. CRUD operates are Create, Read, Update, and Delete. The web app is designed to catalog and manage a collection of movies like a watch list.
